TODO for grml-network
---------------------

Write manpages for:

* grml-network: main interface to configure network setup / cards.
   Synopsis: 'grml-network'. Set environment variable NOCHECK
   to skip network status check. Run 'grml-network check' to
   execute network status check and exit immediately afterwards.
* netcardconfig: a very light-weight text-based network configuration tool
